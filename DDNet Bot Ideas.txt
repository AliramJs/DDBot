    - Able to pull up a random map (either of a random difficulty as well or a pre-defined difficulty.)
    - Able to search for the most finished map you don't have finished (of a certain difficulty, or overall), probably able to search under other parameters as well.

• Party Maker <-- Inspired by Meeu's "Nobot" Discord Bot. 
    - Able to set up a party/group in discord for certain map(s).
    - Creates a private Text Channel & VC for group members (likely set to expire after 12-24h, or maybe x hours of inactivity.)
