# DDBot
Discord Bot for DDNet related things (https://ddnet.tw)

Fairly new to coding so don't expect it to be clean code

If you have any ideas or have any bugs to report feel free to do so.
You can also directly contact me on discord (Broso56#5656), however my DM's are limited to friends only so you will have to try and add me first.
                                            ^ I'd suggest being in a ddnet-related server that I'm also in. Otherwise I might mistake you for some random person or bot.

# Bot Setup Tutorial
    - Follow instructions for making a bot profile
    - Create file 'clienttoken.py' with 'token = YOUR_TOKEN'
    - Download files needed
    - Download imports needed
    - Select needed scopes & permissions
    - run 'run.py'

    NOTE: I have not personally tested this, but in theory this should work. Sorry in advance if it doesnt however, and feel free to contact me if need be.

- **Scopes**:
    - bot
    - applications.commands

- **Bot Permissions**

    - Manage Messages
    - Use Slash Commands
    - **NOTE: You might have to add more if this becomes outdated. Keep in mind the intents/scopes/perms if the bot errors.**
